# ABOUT MUSIC FESTIVAL

## A simple one page project of a hypothetical music festival, exhibiting the lineup, a picture gallery and more, applying Gulp, Node and Sass, among other stuff.

Description corta del proyecto single page, permite ver distintos eventos en un festival de música hipotético, construida con lo que dice arriba

This project was created to put in practice the following features:

·It’s responsive for four screen sizes
·Lots of flexbox and grid
·Uses a css gradient on top of the background video at the top of the page
·Has a fixed navigation so it’s still in your screen when you scroll down
·Counts with smooth scroll, and scroll into view
·Creates a modal window to display any image you choose to see
·Creation of a gallery with JS
.Minification, optimization and compilation of my code and files (such as pictures and videos) with automated functions in the gulp file.

To run this project you need to install NPM - Node Package Manager - via console with the command: ´npm i´ .

Then, you can run all automated tasks with te command: ´gulp dev´ .

NOTES: The design is NOT my own. I just found a nice design and coded it. Didn’t use ANY framework, except normalize (CSS, not javascript’s normalize).
